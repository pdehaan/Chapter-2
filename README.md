This project will look into Jade, a templating engine originally developed for the Node.js platform. It will involve developing a blog as a use case, using templates for individual posts and the blog as a whole. As a blog has overlapping CSS classes between its main page (with several blog posts) and individual posts, this chapter will demonstrate the importance of using a CSS pre-processor to simplify one's styling. The project will also emphasize the importance of compression, minification and obfuscation in developing a high-traffic blog as a use case.
